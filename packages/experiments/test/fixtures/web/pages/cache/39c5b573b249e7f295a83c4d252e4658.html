It was updated on Aug. 11, 2018]<\/em><\/p><p>QUINCY, Ill. --For Curtis Lovelace and his family, Feb. 14, 2006, may seem like a long time ago. But, for the second time in two years, the husband and children of Cory Lovelace are about to relive those difficult days after she died. This time is in a different courthouse, in a different city:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"The defendant\u0027s first wife, Cory Lovelace, was suffocated... That will be our medical evidence,\" Prosecutor &nbsp;David Robinson told jurors in his opening statements. \"The way I describe circumstantial evidence is as follows \u2026 I like to look at it as pebbles in a mosaic. \u2026And you\u0027re gonna step away from that mosaic \u2026 and you know what it\u0027s gonna say? Murder.\"&nbsp;<\/p><p>\"Opening statements are about what the evidence is gonna show. The State had an opportunity to explain to you what evidence they have that Curt Lovelace murdered his wife Cory Lovelace. And they didn\u0027t present it. Because there is none,\" defense attorney Jon Loevy told the court. \"In the age of supposed fake news, this is a fake case and there are fake witnesses... No evidence of any homicide.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>But first you need to know how this all got started. <\/p><p>It\u0027s Friday night in Quincy, Illinois, and thousands have come out to cheer for the home team. Local journalist Bob Gough swaps his keyboard for a microphone and moonlights as an announcer. <\/p><p>\"If you\u0027re a local sports star, you know people are always wanting to know about you,\" he said. <\/p><div data-shortcode=\"image\" data-uuid=\"ac643ac4-64ab-4c00-ad5f-ef2f8b0326de\" data-size=\"x_large\" data-float=\"left\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Curtis Lovelace was a star student-athlete at Quincy High School<\/p>\" data-image-alt-text=\"Curtis Lovelace\" data-image-filename=\"lovelace3.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2017\/03\/17\" data-image-width=\"1709\" data-image-height=\"1413\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"false\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"false\" data-image-watermark=\"false\" data-lightbox=\"false\"><\/div><p>And at Quincy High in the 1980s, there was no bigger star than Blue Devil\u0027s Hall-of-Famer Curtis Lovelace, both on the field and in the classroom.<\/p><p>\"Curtis Lovelace was a very hard working kid, smart kid,\" said Gough. <\/p><p>The University of Illinois gave Lovelace, No. 54, a scholarship to play football.<\/p><p>But he wasn\u0027t just any player. Lovelace, a business administration major, was considered one of the top offensive linemen in the Big Ten -- a team captain who lead the \"Fighting Illini\" to the conference championship his senior year. <\/p><p>\"He even got a look in free-agent camp in the NFL with the Patriots,\" Gough explained. \"Had a bad knee injury, which, not sure if he woulda made it or not, but that certainly didn\u0027t help the situation. But being a smart kid, Curtis already had other goals in mind.\" <\/p><p>While still in college, Curtis started a long distance relationship with high school classmate Cory Didriksen, who was studying communications at the University of Iowa. &nbsp; <\/p><p>\"She just had a perfect smile,\" Cory\u0027s mother, Marty Didriksen, told CBS affiliate <a href=\"http:\/\/khqa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">KHQA<\/a>. \"And she just smiled at everyone. And she just did stuff.\" <\/p><p>\"Cory was vibrant, dynamic. A little bit of stubbornness, and she was a pistol and I loved her for that,\" said friend Steve Belko.<\/p><p>Belko, Beth Dobrzynski and Bret Schrader grew up with Cory and Curtis in Quincy.&nbsp; &nbsp; <\/p><p>\"Curt was easygoing he was a gentleman, fun loving, intelligent \u2013 a gentlemen,\" said Belko.<\/p><p>\"Do you think they were well matched?\" \"48 Hours\" correspondent Maureen Maher asked the group of friends.<\/p><p>\"I did. I did. Well, they looked great together, but they had a lot of similarities and they seemed to have fun together,\" Dobrzynski replied.<\/p><div data-shortcode=\"image\" data-uuid=\"04941099-27e0-45dd-93da-59b8b48e693d\" data-size=\"x_large\" data-float=\"left\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Curtis and Cory Lovelace<\/p>\" data-image-credit=\"Marty Didriksen\" data-image-alt-text=\"Curtis and Cory Lovelace\" data-image-filename=\"lovelacewedding770.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016\/02\/20\" data-image-width=\"770\" data-image-height=\"433\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"false\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"false\" data-image-watermark=\"false\" data-lightbox=\"false\"><\/div><p>In 1991, just one year after graduation, they were<em> <\/em>married.

The pictures you know, you could see on their faces,\" Dobrzynski reminisced. \"It was a magical night.\"<\/p><p>With Cory by his side, Curtis Lovelace had grand plans. He attended law school and eventually became an assistant state\u0027s attorney in the city they both loved, Quincy.<\/p><p>\"What did Cory want to do with her life? \u2026 What were her dreams?\" Maher asked Dobrzynski.<\/p><p>\"Cory was all about family,\" she replied. \"She wanted the big family. \u2026the happy marriage, you know, being involved in Quincy.\"<\/p><div data-shortcode=\"image\" data-uuid=\"08f1a634-2133-4455-b241-2f778569b6b2\" data-size=\"x_large\" data-float=\"left\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Curtis and Cory Lovelace and their four children<\/p>\" data-image-credit=\"Marty Didriksen\" data-image-alt-text=\"lovelace-family.jpg\" data-image-filename=\"lovelace-family.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2017\/03\/17\" data-image-width=\"2000\" data-image-height=\"1428\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"false\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"false\" data-image-watermark=\"false\" data-lightbox=\"false\"><\/div><p>Cory\u0027s dream came true in 1993, when their first child, Lyndsay, was born, and continued with the addition of three sons: Logan, Lincoln, and Larson.<\/p><p>\"She was a loving person. I grew up -- she was involved, head room mother, PTA, always there at our games, dance recitals, everything-- our number one cheerleader, said Lyndsay, who is now in her 20s.<\/p><p>\"Do you have a fondest memory of her?\" Maher asked.<\/p><p>\"I would say dancing to ABBA in the kitchen. She always played ABBA and we always sang along and twirling around and it was just special and I still listen because it\u0027s everything to me,\" she replied, laughing.<\/p><p>&nbsp;In 2005, while still at the state\u0027s attorney\u0027s office, he started his own law firm. And, as if he wasn\u0027t busy enough, Lovelace was elected president of the school board, became a captain in the Illinois National Guard, and an adjunct professor at Quincy University.<\/p><p>\"\u2026 big man on campus.&nbsp; And he always kind of had that air about him,\" said Gough.&nbsp; <\/p><p>\"Was he arrogant?\" Maher asked.<\/p><p>\"He became arrogant more and more, yes,\" Belko replied. \"There was a little bit of holier than thou. \u2026Maybe you were entitled to this living. I think he lost friends over time because of that.\" <\/p><div data-shortcode=\"video\" data-uuid=\"15910e89-e1b7-467b-b4f1-88acdaa7de04\" data-size=\"large\" data-float=\"left\"><\/div><p>The situation at home was changing, as well. Curtis\u0027 working long hours away from Cory and the kids was taking a toll on their personal life.<\/p><p>\"They fought.&nbsp; At a young age \u2026 I thought it was normal,\" Lyndsay explained. \"But then growing up later on after she was gone, I realized that it wasn\u0027t normal.\"<\/p><p>Neighbors around the Lovelace house on Kentucky Street say that in the months leading up to her death, they had heard loud and contentious arguments between Cory and Curtis. By many accounts, both were heavy drinkers. And in this small community, it was known that at times there was a tremendous amount of turmoil in their home.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>Her family acknowledges Cory was suffering with an eating disorder -- bulimia.<\/p><p>\"I knew that -- she wasn\u0027t taking care of herself. I was aware of the \u2013 bulimia. \u2026 the binging and the \u2026 purging late in the day,\" Curtis told Maher.<\/p><div data-shortcode=\"image\" data-uuid=\"9c45b2ea-ca8b-4441-a973-22d65a1d19a6\" data-size=\"x_large\" data-float=\"left\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Cory and Curtis Lovelace<\/p>\" data-image-credit=\"Steve Belko\" data-image-alt-text=\"Cory and Curtis Lovelace\" data-image-filename=\"loveless-cory-curtis.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2017\/03\/17\" data-image-width=\"1280\" data-image-height=\"960\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"false\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"false\" data-image-watermark=\"false\" data-lightbox=\"false\"><\/div><p>\"Cory -- Cory was an alcoholic. And -- unfortunately-- so much of alcoholism, all of alcoholism is \u2013 is -- is not-- is not pretty. It\u0027s -- it\u0027s -- it\u0027s ugly. And \u2026 it brings out, oftentimes, the worst in -- in people. And-- it was something that she-- she struggled with,\" said Curtis Lovelace. <\/p><p>\"You said you drank. Would you describe yourself as an alcoholic?\" Maher asked.<\/p><p>&nbsp;\"I do describe my -- myself as an alcoholic,\" Curtis replied.<\/p><p>Was Cory\u0027s death the result of her alcohol abuse or was it murder? It was a question that would go unanswered for almost eight years -- until a rookie detective would take a new look at this old case.<\/p><h2>A NEW LOOK AT THE CASE <\/h2><p>In 2014, Adam Gibson, as a newly promoted detective, decided to take a look at file on a case he was always curious about: the death of Cory Lovelace eight years earlier -- a death ruled as \"undetermined.\"<\/p><p>\"And I was at the office \u2026 just reading old case files, and the Lovelace case popped into my head,\" he said. \"After seein\u0027 the photos, that\u0027s when I went to the chief and asked him if -- if I could take a look at it again.\"<\/p><p>The photos of Cory\u0027s body show her arms slightly elevated above her chest. &nbsp; <\/p><p>\"That didn\u0027t really make sense, and there was no explanation for \u0027em,\" said Det. Gibson.<\/p><div data-shortcode=\"image\" data-uuid=\"810fc4f7-2f69-4668-a374-ae97c818c414\" data-size=\"x_large\" data-float=\"left\" data-image-caption=\"<p>A drawing by artist Bill Beard of a graphic photo of Cory Lovelace illustrating the position of her hands<\/p>\" data-image-alt-text=\"A drawing by artist Bill Beard of a graphic photo of Cory Lovelace\" data-image-filename=\"lovelacesketch.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016\/02\/20\" data-image-width=\"770\" data-image-height=\"433\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"false\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"false\" data-image-watermark=\"false\" data-lightbox=\"false\"><\/div><p>In re-opening the case, Gibson first consulted Adams County Coroner James Keller, who was deputy coroner in 2006, when he was called to the Lovelace house the morning of February 14.<\/p><p>\"Upon entering the -- the bedroom, I notice the -- female lying on the bed on her back-- with her hands kind of in an upright position.\" Keller explained.<\/p><p>\"A body always tells a story the way you find them,\" he continued.<\/p><p>\"What is the story that Cory\u0027s body was telling you?\" Maher asked.<\/p><p>\"That she had passed earlier that prior evening or day,\" said Keller.<\/p><p>Detective Gibson contacted Dr. Jane Turner, an assistant medical examiner in St. Louis, who agreed with Keller\u0027s assessment that Cory\u0027s body had stiffened -- a condition called \"rigor mortis,\" which only happens over an extended period of time.<\/p><p>\"In my report, I stated 10 to 12 hours.&nbsp; Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours,\" said Turner.&nbsp; <\/p><p>And it was the position of Cory\u0027s arms that led Dr. Turner to the theory that Cory had been suffocated. <\/p><p>\"What did you determine would have caused the suffocation?\" Maher asked Dr. Turner.<\/p><p>\"Well, with the position of the hands, it suggests that there was an object between her hands and her body. And it appears that there is a pillow missing,\" she replied. \"So I suppose that a pillow was used to suffocate her.\"<\/p><p>Turner theorized that the pillow had not been removed until much later, after Cory\u0027s arms had frozen around it -- that her dead body had laid in bed all night. <\/p><p>Gibson and Turner\u0027s theory of murder was a very different account than the one Curtis Lovelace gave police. Curtis says it all started the weekend before Valentine\u0027s Day.<\/p><p>\"She had become ill, she appeared to have the have the flu,\" Curtis told Maher.<\/p><p>Lyndsay remembers comforting her mom, while watching the 2006 Winter Olympics together in the days leading up to Cory\u0027s death.<\/p><p>\"We laid in bed, having fun watching that. And it was just special \u0027cause it was me and her,\" she said.<\/p><p>But Curtis insists Cory was very much alive Valentine\u0027s morning.<\/p><p>\"The vivid memory is -- is her coming down. One of the ch -- one of the kids needed -- a pair of pants,\" he said.<\/p><p>\"\u2026she wasn\u0027t feelin\u0027 any better. And we made the decision that -- I would take the kids to school,\" said Curtis.<\/p><p>Four-year-old Larson stayed home while Curtis dropped off the other kids. Larson would later tell police that on that morning he couldn\u0027t wake mommy up. Frightened, he waited at the top of the stairs for his dad. By 9 a.m., Curtis had returned, and that\u0027s when he found Cory dead in their bed. <\/p><p>\"What was your reaction?\" Maher asked Curtis.<\/p><p>\"Just utter shock. In fact -- I\u0027m -- I\u0027m not even sure how I reacted. I know what I did.\" he replied. <\/p><p>Oddly, Curtis did not react by calling 911.<\/p><p>\"What I saw was someone who didn\u0027t need help. I just saw my wife who had passed away,\" he said.<\/p><p>Curtis Lovelace says, at that moment, his main concern was to get his youngest child, Larson, out of the house. At trial, Cory\u0027s mother, Marty Didriksen, testifies that Curtis brought him over to her house, which was just around the corner:<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>MARTY DIDRIKSEN<\/strong>: Sometime after 9 \u2026 Curtis knocks on the door and he asks if I would watch Larson, so I take Larson and he turns and he says, \"Oh by the way Cory\u0027s dead.\"<\/p><p><strong>PROSECUTOR PARKINSON<\/strong>: Then what did Mr. Lovelace do? <\/p><p><strong>MARTY DIDRIKSEN<\/strong>: He turned to leave and I\u0027m trying to think [becomes emotional]. I think I remember the fact that I said \"I wanna go\" and he said \"everything\u0027s been taken care of\" and left. <\/p><p><strong>PROSECUTOR PARKINSON:<\/strong> Did he stay there and explain to you what he knew?<\/p><p><strong>MARTY DIDRIKSEN<\/strong>: No, no.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>\"Did you have anything to do with the death of your wife, Cory?\" Maher asked. <\/p><p>\"I did not,\" Curtis replied.<\/p><p>But Detective Gibson wasn\u0027t buying it. His investigation would lead to an indictment, an arrest, and Curtis Lovelace\u0027s first trial -- 10 years after his wife\u0027s death. <\/p><div data-shortcode=\"gallery\" data-uuid=\"3b9560fc-5f38-49b4-bd6e-aeebf431f835\" data-float=\"left\" data-size=\"large\"><\/div><p>\"To not only be called a murderer, but to say that I murdered the mother of my children, it\u0027s horrible. This is a prosecution that should have never been brought.&nbsp; There never should have been an indictment,\" Curtis told Maher.<\/p><p>The jury deadlocked, unable to decide if Cory was murdered. <\/p><p>Curtis Lovelace was out of jail, but for how long?&nbsp; One year later, there was a new trial, a new jury, but the same question: did Cory die from alcohol abuse or something more sinister? <\/p><p>The second trial would be the culmination of events that began 11 years ago that Valentine\u0027s Day morning.<\/p><p>The grim details of that morning would also be embedded in the minds of those who were there. EMT Cole Miller was among the first on the scene.<\/p><p>\"She was laying in the bed and her arms were drawn up by her chest,\" Miller explained, holding up his arms to show how Cory\u0027s were positioned. \"And I went in there to check for signs of life, checked her carotid pulse in her neck, and then checked her wrist and saw that it was cold and stiff.\"<\/p><p>Jeff Baird was the lead detective in the case in 2006:&nbsp; <\/p><blockquote><p><strong>DEFENSE ATTORNEY JON LOEVY:<\/strong> You determined that this investigation should be closed because there was no evidence of foul play?<\/p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD<\/strong>: That is what we determined.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Defense Attorney Jon Loevy asks him to describe the scene:<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: Did you find anything whatsoever that seemed consistent with any kind of struggle?<\/p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD<\/strong>: No.<\/p><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: Did you find any evidence of a homicide? <\/p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD<\/strong>: No -- <\/p><\/blockquote><p>The autopsy also found no signs of a homicide. Adams County pathologist Jessica Bowman ruled the cause of death as \"undetermined.\"&nbsp; <\/p><blockquote><p><strong>PROSECUTOR<\/strong>: Were you surprised it came back undetermined?<\/p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD<\/strong>: I think it was unexpected. And I was expecting to see a death from natural causes related to a health condition.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Baird also didn\u0027t expect to see, on the day he discovered Cory, the condition of her hands and arms:<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD<\/strong>: Her arms were up in an unnatural position. ... Her hands and arms from the elbow to the hand were leaning or resting against her abdomen and appeared to be up.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It is this strange position of Cory\u0027s arms that would become a critical and controversial piece of this case. &nbsp; <\/p><blockquote><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD<\/strong>: There was mild rigor in one of her arms, there was moderate rigor in the other. Rigor was also forming in her legs.<\/p><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: Let\u0027s be real clear\u2014were her arms still pliable? <\/p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD<\/strong>: Yes. <\/p><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: Tell the jury what pliable means. <\/p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD<\/strong>: We could move them.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The defense argues, if Cory\u0027s arms were pliable, it would indicate she could have died that morning. And that\u0027s in direct contrast to James Keller\u0027s testimony. <\/p><p>\"The -- body was in a full state of rigor -- rigor mortis,\" Keller said on the stand.<\/p><p>However long Cory Lovelace had been dead, to Keller, it certainly appeared that medical rigor mortis had set in. <\/p><p>\"The state of rigor mortis to get in that position-- generally, the rule of thumb of anywhere from eight to 12 hours,\" Keller explained.<\/p><p>\"Did it make any sense to you that they were saying it was that morning?\" Maher asked.<\/p><p>\"It did not,\" Keller replied. \"It just didn\u0027t seem to add up.\"<\/p><p>Two days after Cory\u0027s death, her body was cremated and the case was closed. A 38-year-old woman was suddenly dead for seemingly no apparent reason.&nbsp; <\/p><p>\"We assumed that -- that her -- her eating disorder, that her alcoholism -- somehow caused her death. And whether it was checked undetermined -- or natural death really wasn\u0027t something that we were concerned about,\" Curtis told Maher.<\/p><p>\"And life went on?\" Maher asked reporter Bob Gough.<\/p><p>&nbsp;\"Yeah,\" he replied.<\/p><p>In fact, six months later, life did move on. Curtis met his second wife, Erika Gomez. <\/p><p>Gomez would become an explosive figure in his second trial, with riveting testimony.<\/p><p>\"She was banned from the first trial,\" KHQA reporter Jenny Dreasler told Maher. \"She\u0027s the biggest difference in this case. A lotta people saying that she was the missing puzzle piece to why we\u0027re even here to begin with.\"<\/p><h2>A SECOND TRIAL<br><\/h2><p>After his wife, Cory, mysteriously passed away in 2006, it took Curtis Lovelace less than six months to find love again, this time with one of his students at Quincy University, Erika Gomez.&nbsp; <\/p><p>\"I remember my dad coming up to me and -- saying, \u0027Hey, just so you know, I\u0027ve been seeing this woman,\" said Lyndsay Lovelace.<\/p><p>&nbsp;\"And what was your reaction?\" Maher asked.<\/p><p>&nbsp;\"I was shocked, but couldn\u0027t process it at the same time because what 12-year-old\u0027s gonna process a parent dating especially so quickly after the loss?\" Lyndsay replied. <\/p><p>\"Looking back, it was, I think, properly characterized as -- as a rebound relationship. I -- I regret starting the relationship and\u2026\" said Curtis Lovelace.<\/p><p>\"Were you lonely?\" Maher asked.<\/p><p>\"Absolutely,\" he replied.<\/p><p>Two years later, Curtis and Erika were married.<\/p><p>\"And what was your relationship like with Erika?\" Maher asked Lyndsay.<\/p><p>\"Not good at all. I -- for some reason, there was some hatred towards my mom \u2026 like she was public enemy number one. So I would tell her to stop. Like, \u0027It\u0027s not fair,\u0027\" Lyndsay explained. \"And then I would get punished for that.\" <\/p><p>Asked by whom, Lyndsay said, \"By Erika. And what scared me more was that my dad would sit there and watch it.\"<\/p><p>It didn\u0027t take long for things to go from bad to much worse.&nbsp; &nbsp; <\/p><p>\"It was Christmas Eve and \u2026 my mom\u0027s side of the family \u2026 had invited \u2026 all of us to come, for a family dinner. \u2026Christmas was my mom\u0027s favorite holiday,\" Lyndsay explained. \"And I was crying \u2026 because I missed her and I wanted her there. And all of a sudden \u2026 Erika walks in and says, \u0027We\u0027re leaving now.\u0027 And I\u0027m like, \u0027Give me a second to calm down.\u0027\"<\/p><p>\"So I \u2026 go to walk out the door, find out that my dad, Erika, the boys and my -- stepsister had left,\" Lyndsay continued. \"Erika had left her purse -- at the house and my family was not happy with them leaving me. \u2026So she came back to get it and my family wouldn\u0027t let her in.

TURNER ON STAND<\/strong>: Given the circumstances in which her body was found and the altered scene, it appears she did die of homicide from suffocation.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>A logical conclusion, except for the fact that when questioned by Quincy Police, the Lovelace children -- all except Larson -- said they saw their mother alive on the stairs before going off to school the morning Gibson believed Cory was already dead<strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp; <\/strong><\/p><p>\"When Adam Gibson came to speak to you and he asked you, \u0027Do you remember?\u0027 you told him that you did.

Gibson.<\/p><p>\"I\u0027m 100 percent certain,\" he replied.<\/p><p>But defense attorney Jon Loevy was about to challenge everything Det. Adam Gibson believed about the death of Cory Lovelace.&nbsp; <\/p><p>\"Adam Gibson decided to create a crime where one didn\u0027t exist,\" Curtis told Maher.<\/p><h2>BATTLE OF THE EXPERTS<\/h2><p>Prosecutor Ed Parkinson brings in three forensic pathologists to prove Detective Gibson\u0027s theory that Cory was murdered. <\/p><p>From world-renowned&nbsp; Dr. Werner Spitz: \"Ms. Lovelace died in my view of suffocation,\" he told the court.&nbsp; <\/p><p>To Dr. Scott Denton, the pathologist first consulted when the case was reopened.&nbsp; \"I would determine her cause of death to be suffocation,\" Dr. Denton testified.<\/p><p>And finally, Dr. Jane Turner, the out-of-state expert who also believes Cory was suffocated.&nbsp; Defense attorney Jon Loevy tries to discredit Dr. Turner, saying she never saw Cory\u0027s body and her opinion that Cory\u0027s body was in full rigor mortis conflicts with the first responders on the scene.<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: For you to be right Jeff Baird has to be wrong about his assessment, right?<\/p><p><strong>DR. TURNER<\/strong>: Yes. <\/p><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: For you to be right paramedic Ballard has to be wrong about his assessment that the arm was still pliable. Correct?<\/p><p><strong>DR. TURNER<\/strong>: Yes. <\/p><\/blockquote><p>If Cory Lovelace\u0027s body was pliable, as the defense claims, full rigor mortis had not set in and she didn\u0027t die the night before.<\/p><p>And when Coroner Keller is cross-examined, Loevy belittles his role in the case:<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: You were at the scene of Cory\u0027s death for all of five minutes. Correct, sir? <\/p><p><strong>CORONER JAMES KELLER<\/strong>: Probably, yes sir.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Loevy came down hardest on Detective Gibson.<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: You continued to pursue Mr. Lovelace, right? \u2026Because you had already decided that this man must be guilty.&nbsp; <\/p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON<\/strong>: No. <\/p><\/blockquote><p>He grills Gibson about rigor mortis:<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY:<\/strong> At what point did you learn that you were wrong that the body was in full rigor at the scene?&nbsp; <\/p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON<\/strong>:&nbsp; I don\u0027t know to this day that I\u0027m wrong. <\/p><\/blockquote><p>Then, a new twist: Loevy accuses Gibson of withholding evidence -- emails that never made it into the first trial:<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: You did delete all your emails in January 2016, did you not?&nbsp; <\/p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON<\/strong>: Yes.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The defense was able to recover those emails. Loevy reads one email from a pathologist who told Gibson he could never make a good murder case since Cory\u0027s death had originally been ruled undetermined.<\/p><p>\"\u0027That is more than reasonable doubt in any reasonable person\u0027s mind,\u0027\" Lovey read aloud from the pathologiost\u0027s email.<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: This email should\u0027ve been turned over, right?<\/p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON:<\/strong> I-- I believe so. It should, yes.<\/p><p><strong>JON LOEVY<\/strong>: You didn\u0027t turn it over, did you?<\/p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON<\/strong>: I did not.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>But Gibson testified that he never engaged in any intentional wrongdoing.<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>PROSECUTOR DAVID ROBINSON<\/strong>: And have you ever intentionally deleted or modified emails to manipulate an investigation?<\/p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON<\/strong>: No.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Loevy calls to the stand his own noted pathologist, Dr. William Oliver -- who was on the O.J. Simpson case.&nbsp; Dr. Oliver had no doubt how Cory died.<\/p><p>\"It is my opinion that she died of the complication of alcohol withdrawal known as acute fatty liver,\" he testified.<\/p><p>After a battle of the experts, the defense gambles that the most believable witness might be the accused killer himself.<\/p><p>\"As I approached the bed, I could see her hands, I could see her eyes were open, and she was very pale and there was just \u2014nothing there.&nbsp; Cory was dead.&nbsp; That\u0027s what I saw, that\u0027s what I saw,\" Curtis Lovelace told the court. <\/p><p>\"I told them multiple times I had nothing to do with Cory\u0027s death,\" he testified.<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY: <\/strong>Being accused of a cold-blooded murder, that reduces your likability factor, correct? <\/p><p><strong>CURTIS LOVELACE<\/strong>: (EMOTIONAL) A little bit.<\/p><p><strong>JON LOEVY: <\/strong>Do you feel like everything you say, every decision you make ,is now being picked over and being twisted unfairly. <\/p><p><strong>CURTIS LOVELACE<\/strong>: We have been doing this for two-and-a-half years.<\/p><p>And it was remembering the time right after Cory died\u2014that Curtis became most emotional.<\/p><p><strong>CURTIS LOVELACE <\/strong>[EMOTIONAL]: \u2026one of our high school classmates who was a pastor, he\u0027s the one that -- that delivered the eulogy.

Pretend that you\u0027re doing OK,\" Loevy told Parkinson. <\/p><p>\"I\u0027ve objected to his antics. I\u0027ve told him to shut up. I don\u0027t like him,\" said Parkinson.<\/p><p>After seven days of testimony in Curtis Lovelace\u0027s second murder trial, the jury continues hearing closing arguments\"<\/p><blockquote><p>\"So here we are. What has the state shown? Cory died from suffocation and he did it!\" Prosecutor David Robinson told the court. \"He had a motive \u2026 she was an alcoholic, she yelled at&nbsp; him, she yelled at the kids and that night he had enough \u2026 the state asks you to find Curtis Lovelace guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt.\"<\/p><p>\"There is no evidence in this case that this woman was smothered. She died a natural death,\" Loevy told the court. \"They have no murder weapon no forensic evidence \u2026 he went out trying to prove a case when there was no crime.\"<\/p><p>\"This is a rebuttal \u2026 its not gonna take long. Because he committed a stupid crime, this Mr. Smart man here,\" Parkinson told jurors. \"And you can do your job now because the only thing that makes sense here is that she was suffocated.

It was updated on Aug. 11, 2018]</em></p><p>QUINCY, Ill. --For Curtis Lovelace and his family, Feb. 14, 2006, may seem like a long time ago. But, for the second time in two years, the husband and children of Cory Lovelace are about to relive those difficult days after she died. This time is in a different courthouse, in a different city:</p><blockquote><p>"The defendant's first wife, Cory Lovelace, was suffocated... That will be our medical evidence," Prosecutor &nbsp;David Robinson told jurors in his opening statements. "The way I describe circumstantial evidence is as follows &hellip; I like to look at it as pebbles in a mosaic. &hellip;And you're gonna step away from that mosaic &hellip; and you know what it's gonna say? Murder."&nbsp;</p><p>"Opening statements are about what the evidence is gonna show. The State had an opportunity to explain to you what evidence they have that Curt Lovelace murdered his wife Cory Lovelace. And they didn't present it. Because there is none," defense attorney Jon Loevy told the court. "In the age of supposed fake news, this is a fake case and there are fake witnesses... No evidence of any homicide."</p></blockquote><p>But first you need to know how this all got started. </p><p>It's Friday night in Quincy, Illinois, and thousands have come out to cheer for the home team. Local journalist Bob Gough swaps his keyboard for a microphone and moonlights as an announcer. </p><p>"If you're a local sports star, you know people are always wanting to know about you," he said. </p><figure class="image pull-left image-x-large "><span class="img "><img src="https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/17/ac643ac4-64ab-4c00-ad5f-ef2f8b0326de/resize/770x/b52d0ad2f36cda6bff22522b94238b59/lovelace3.jpg#" alt="Curtis Lovelace " srcset="https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/17/ac643ac4-64ab-4c00-ad5f-ef2f8b0326de/resize/770x/b52d0ad2f36cda6bff22522b94238b59/lovelace3.jpg 1x"></span><figcaption><div class="caption"><p>Curtis Lovelace was a star student-athlete at Quincy High School</p></div></figcaption></figure><p>And at Quincy High in the 1980s, there was no bigger star than Blue Devil's Hall-of-Famer Curtis Lovelace, both on the field and in the classroom.</p><p>"Curtis Lovelace was a very hard working kid, smart kid," said Gough. </p><p>The University of Illinois gave Lovelace, No. 54, a scholarship to play football.</p><p>But he wasn't just any player. Lovelace, a business administration major, was considered one of the top offensive linemen in the Big Ten -- a team captain who lead the "Fighting Illini" to the conference championship his senior year. </p><p>"He even got a look in free-agent camp in the NFL with the Patriots," Gough explained. "Had a bad knee injury, which, not sure if he woulda made it or not, but that certainly didn't help the situation. But being a smart kid, Curtis already had other goals in mind." </p><p>While still in college, Curtis started a long distance relationship with high school classmate Cory Didriksen, who was studying communications at the University of Iowa. &nbsp; </p><p>"She just had a perfect smile," Cory's mother, Marty Didriksen, told CBS affiliate <a href="http://khqa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KHQA</a>. "And she just smiled at everyone. And she just did stuff." </p><p>"Cory was vibrant, dynamic.

"But then growing up later on after she was gone, I realized that it wasn't normal."</p><p>Neighbors around the Lovelace house on Kentucky Street say that in the months leading up to her death, they had heard loud and contentious arguments between Cory and Curtis.

And in this small community, it was known that at times there was a tremendous amount of turmoil in their home.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Her family acknowledges Cory was suffering with an eating disorder -- bulimia.</p><p>"I knew that -- she wasn't taking care of herself.

And-- it was something that she-- she struggled with," said Curtis Lovelace. </p><p>"You said you drank. Would you describe yourself as an alcoholic?" Maher asked.</p><p>&nbsp;"I do describe my -- myself as an alcoholic," Curtis replied.</p><p>Was Cory's death the result of her alcohol abuse or was it murder? It was a question that would go unanswered for almost eight years -- until a rookie detective would take a new look at this old case.</p><h2>A NEW LOOK AT THE CASE </h2><p>In 2014, Adam Gibson, as a newly promoted detective, decided to take a look at file on a case he was always curious about: the death of Cory Lovelace eight years earlier -- a death ruled as "undetermined."</p><p>"And I was at the office &hellip; just reading old case files, and the Lovelace case popped into my head," he said. "After seein' the photos, that's when I went to the chief and asked him if -- if I could take a look at it again."</p><p>The photos of Cory's body show her arms slightly elevated above her chest. &nbsp; </p><p>"That didn't really make sense, and there was no explanation for 'em," said Det. Gibson.</p><figure class="image pull-left image-x-large "><span class="img "><img src="https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/02/20/810fc4f7-2f69-4668-a374-ae97c818c414/resize/770x/294015c585adf31ee235dfa84df83b28/lovelacesketch.jpg#" alt="A drawing by artist Bill Beard of a graphic photo of Cory Lovelace " srcset="https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/02/20/810fc4f7-2f69-4668-a374-ae97c818c414/resize/770x/294015c585adf31ee235dfa84df83b28/lovelacesketch.jpg 1x"></span><figcaption><div class="caption"><p>A drawing by artist Bill Beard of a graphic photo of Cory Lovelace illustrating the position of her hands</p></div></figcaption></figure><p>In re-opening the case, Gibson first consulted Adams County Coroner James Keller, who was deputy coroner in 2006, when he was called to the Lovelace house the morning of February 14.</p><p>"Upon entering the -- the bedroom, I notice the -- female lying on the bed on her back-- with her hands kind of in an upright position." Keller explained.</p><p>"A body always tells a story the way you find them," he continued.</p><p>"What is the story that Cory's body was telling you?" Maher asked.</p><p>"That she had passed earlier that prior evening or day," said Keller.</p><p>Detective Gibson contacted Dr. Jane Turner, an assistant medical examiner in St. Louis, who agreed with Keller's assessment that Cory's body had stiffened -- a condition called "rigor mortis," which only happens over an extended period of time.</p><p>"In my report, I stated 10 to 12 hours.&nbsp; Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours," said Turner.&nbsp; </p><p>And it was the position of Cory's arms that led Dr. Turner to the theory that Cory had been suffocated. </p><p>"What did you determine would have caused the suffocation?" Maher asked Dr. Turner.</p><p>"Well, with the position of the hands, it suggests that there was an object between her hands and her body. And it appears that there is a pillow missing," she replied. "So I suppose that a pillow was used to suffocate her."</p><p>Turner theorized that the pillow had not been removed until much later, after Cory's arms had frozen around it -- that her dead body had laid in bed all night. </p><p>Gibson and Turner's theory of murder was a very different account than the one Curtis Lovelace gave police. Curtis says it all started the weekend before Valentine's Day.</p><p>"She had become ill, she appeared to have the have the flu," Curtis told Maher.</p><p>Lyndsay remembers comforting her mom, while watching the 2006 Winter Olympics together in the days leading up to Cory's death.</p><p>"We laid in bed, having fun watching that. And it was just special 'cause it was me and her," she said.</p><p>But Curtis insists Cory was very much alive Valentine's morning.</p><p>"The vivid memory is -- is her coming down. One of the ch -- one of the kids needed -- a pair of pants," he said.</p><p>"&hellip;she wasn't feelin' any better. And we made the decision that -- I would take the kids to school," said Curtis.</p><p>Four-year-old Larson stayed home while Curtis dropped off the other kids. Larson would later tell police that on that morning he couldn't wake mommy up. Frightened, he waited at the top of the stairs for his dad. By 9 a.m., Curtis had returned, and that's when he found Cory dead in their bed. </p><p>"What was your reaction?" Maher asked Curtis.</p><p>"Just utter shock. In fact -- I'm -- I'm not even sure how I reacted. I know what I did." he replied. </p><p>Oddly, Curtis did not react by calling 911.</p><p>"What I saw was someone who didn't need help. I just saw my wife who had passed away," he said.</p><p>Curtis Lovelace says, at that moment, his main concern was to get his youngest child, Larson, out of the house. At trial, Cory's mother, Marty Didriksen, testifies that Curtis brought him over to her house, which was just around the corner:</p><blockquote><p><strong>MARTY DIDRIKSEN</strong>: Sometime after 9 &hellip; Curtis knocks on the door and he asks if I would watch Larson, so I take Larson and he turns and he says, "Oh by the way Cory's dead."</p><p><strong>PROSECUTOR PARKINSON</strong>: Then what did Mr. Lovelace do? </p><p><strong>MARTY DIDRIKSEN</strong>: He turned to leave and I'm trying to think [becomes emotional]. I think I remember the fact that I said "I wanna go" and he said "everything's been taken care of" and left. </p><p><strong>PROSECUTOR PARKINSON:</strong> Did he stay there and explain to you what he knew?</p><p><strong>MARTY DIDRIKSEN</strong>: No, no.</p></blockquote><p>"Did you have anything to do with the death of your wife, Cory?" Maher asked. </p><p>"I did not," Curtis replied.</p><p>But Detective Gibson wasn't buying it. His investigation would lead to an indictment, an arrest, and Curtis Lovelace's first trial -- 10 years after his wife's death. </p><div class="shortcode-gallery shortcode large left " id="shortcode-gallery">

</div><p>"To not only be called a murderer, but to say that I murdered the mother of my children, it's horrible. This is a prosecution that should have never been brought.&nbsp; There never should have been an indictment," Curtis told Maher.</p><p>The jury deadlocked, unable to decide if Cory was murdered. </p><p>Curtis Lovelace was out of jail, but for how long?&nbsp; One year later, there was a new trial, a new jury, but the same question: did Cory die from alcohol abuse or something more sinister? </p><p>The second trial would be the culmination of events that began 11 years ago that Valentine's Day morning.</p><p>The grim details of that morning would also be embedded in the minds of those who were there. EMT Cole Miller was among the first on the scene.</p><p>"She was laying in the bed and her arms were drawn up by her chest," Miller explained, holding up his arms to show how Cory's were positioned. "And I went in there to check for signs of life, checked her carotid pulse in her neck, and then checked her wrist and saw that it was cold and stiff."</p><p>Jeff Baird was the lead detective in the case in 2006:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><strong>DEFENSE ATTORNEY JON LOEVY:</strong> You determined that this investigation should be closed because there was no evidence of foul play?</p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD</strong>: That is what we determined.</p></blockquote><p>Defense Attorney Jon Loevy asks him to describe the scene:</p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: Did you find anything whatsoever that seemed consistent with any kind of struggle?</p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD</strong>: No.</p><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: Did you find any evidence of a homicide? </p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD</strong>: No -- </p></blockquote><p>The autopsy also found no signs of a homicide. Adams County pathologist Jessica Bowman ruled the cause of death as "undetermined."&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><strong>PROSECUTOR</strong>: Were you surprised it came back undetermined?</p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD</strong>: I think it was unexpected. And I was expecting to see a death from natural causes related to a health condition.</p></blockquote><p>Baird also didn't expect to see, on the day he discovered Cory, the condition of her hands and arms:</p><blockquote><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD</strong>: Her arms were up in an unnatural position. ... Her hands and arms from the elbow to the hand were leaning or resting against her abdomen and appeared to be up.</p></blockquote><p>It is this strange position of Cory's arms that would become a critical and controversial piece of this case. &nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD</strong>: There was mild rigor in one of her arms, there was moderate rigor in the other. Rigor was also forming in her legs.</p><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: Let's be real clear&mdash;were her arms still pliable? </p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD</strong>: Yes. </p><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: Tell the jury what pliable means. </p><p><strong>JEFF BAIRD</strong>: We could move them.</p></blockquote><p>The defense argues, if Cory's arms were pliable, it would indicate she could have died that morning. And that's in direct contrast to James Keller's testimony. </p><p>"The -- body was in a full state of rigor -- rigor mortis," Keller said on the stand.</p><p>However long Cory Lovelace had been dead, to Keller, it certainly appeared that medical rigor mortis had set in. </p><p>"The state of rigor mortis to get in that position-- generally, the rule of thumb of anywhere from eight to 12 hours," Keller explained.</p><p>"Did it make any sense to you that they were saying it was that morning?" Maher asked.</p><p>"It did not," Keller replied. "It just didn't seem to add up."</p><p>Two days after Cory's death, her body was cremated and the case was closed. A 38-year-old woman was suddenly dead for seemingly no apparent reason.&nbsp; </p><p>"We assumed that -- that her -- her eating disorder, that her alcoholism -- somehow caused her death. And whether it was checked undetermined -- or natural death really wasn't something that we were concerned about," Curtis told Maher.</p><p>"And life went on?" Maher asked reporter Bob Gough.</p><p>&nbsp;"Yeah," he replied.</p><p>In fact, six months later, life did move on. Curtis met his second wife, Erika Gomez. </p><p>Gomez would become an explosive figure in his second trial, with riveting testimony.</p><p>"She was banned from the first trial," KHQA reporter Jenny Dreasler told Maher. "She's the biggest difference in this case. A lotta people saying that she was the missing puzzle piece to why we're even here to begin with."</p><h2>A SECOND TRIAL<br></h2><p>After his wife, Cory, mysteriously passed away in 2006, it took Curtis Lovelace less than six months to find love again, this time with one of his students at Quincy University, Erika Gomez.&nbsp; </p><p>"I remember my dad coming up to me and -- saying, 'Hey, just so you know, I've been seeing this woman," said Lyndsay Lovelace.</p><p>&nbsp;"And what was your reaction?" Maher asked.</p><p>&nbsp;"I was shocked, but couldn't process it at the same time because what 12-year-old's gonna process a parent dating especially so quickly after the loss?" Lyndsay replied. </p><p>"Looking back, it was, I think, properly characterized as -- as a rebound relationship. I -- I regret starting the relationship and&hellip;" said Curtis Lovelace.</p><p>"Were you lonely?" Maher asked.</p><p>"Absolutely," he replied.</p><p>Two years later, Curtis and Erika were married.</p><p>"And what was your relationship like with Erika?" Maher asked Lyndsay.</p><p>"Not good at all. I -- for some reason, there was some hatred towards my mom &hellip; like she was public enemy number one. So I would tell her to stop. Like, 'It's not fair,'" Lyndsay explained. "And then I would get punished for that." </p><p>Asked by whom, Lyndsay said, "By Erika. And what scared me more was that my dad would sit there and watch it."</p><p>It didn't take long for things to go from bad to much worse.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>"It was Christmas Eve and &hellip; my mom's side of the family &hellip; had invited &hellip; all of us to come, for a family dinner. &hellip;Christmas was my mom's favorite holiday," Lyndsay explained. "And I was crying &hellip; because I missed her and I wanted her there. And all of a sudden &hellip; Erika walks in and says, 'We're leaving now.' And I'm like, 'Give me a second to calm down.'"</p><p>"So I &hellip; go to walk out the door, find out that my dad, Erika, the boys and my -- stepsister had left," Lyndsay continued. "Erika had left her purse -- at the house and my family was not happy with them leaving me. &hellip;So she came back to get it and my family wouldn't let her in. And that set off a bomb."</p><p>A bomb that blew her family apart.&nbsp; </p><p>"And it -- it blew up to the point where-- when I returned home that evening -- Miss Gomez was throwing Lyndsay's stuff outta the house," said Curtis.</p><p>"My clothes were in the street. &hellip;My room is completely trashed," Lyndsay continued. "I knew my life was never going to be normal ever again."</p><p>&nbsp;"And that's when you moved in with your mom's mom?" Maher asked.</p><p>"Yeah," said Lyndsay.</p><p>Lovelace and Gomez divorced in 2013.</p><p>"I decided that it -- I had made -- a poor decision.

They were married in 2013, just months after his divorce from Gomez.&nbsp; </p><p>"I had a hard time believing that the prosecution actually wanted to put her on the stand," Christine told Maher. "The behavior was so outlandish. The accusations were so outlandish. The fake tears."</p><p>"So you felt that the jury would have zero credibility with her?" Maher asked.</p><p>"Absolutely," Christine replied.</p><p>On the stand for the prosecution was Detective Adam Gibson, who would have to defend his credibility and explain just how he found an expert to support his belief that Cory was murdered.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><strong>PROSECUTOR ROBINSON</strong>: It's been implied that you did some doctor shopping?</p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>PROSECUTOR ROBINSON</strong>: Do you think that's what you did?</p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON</strong>: Absolutely not.</p></blockquote><p>Remember, Dr. Jane Turner sided with Det. Gibson.&nbsp; After studying the evidence, she believed that Cory had died the night before police arrived. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>DR. TURNER ON STAND</strong>: Given the circumstances in which her body was found and the altered scene, it appears she did die of homicide from suffocation.</p></blockquote><p>A logical conclusion, except for the fact that when questioned by Quincy Police, the Lovelace children -- all except Larson -- said they saw their mother alive on the stairs before going off to school the morning Gibson believed Cory was already dead<strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp; </strong></p><p>"When Adam Gibson came to speak to you and he asked you, 'Do you remember?' you told him that you did. You remembered seeing her that morning?" Maher asked Lyndsay.</p><p>"Uh, huh," she affirmed.</p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: And you came to believe that the children were wrong, correct?</p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON</strong>: I -- I didn't say they were wrong. &hellip;I don't know what they saw.</p></blockquote><p>And maybe, neither did they.&nbsp; </p><p>"I had had a story in my head of I saw her sittin' on the stairs, waving to us, 'Goodbye. I love you,' left. And I always said, 'Oh, it was great. I got to say, "I love you,"'" said Lyndsay. </p><p>"Do you remember seeing your mother that Valentine's Day morning?" Maher asked.</p><p>"It's a black hole," Lyndsay replied.</p><p>"You don't know?"</p><p>"No," said Lyndsay.</p><p>"How certain are you now that Curtis Lovelace murdered his wife, Cory?" Maher asked Det. Gibson.</p><p>"I'm 100 percent certain," he replied.</p><p>But defense attorney Jon Loevy was about to challenge everything Det. Adam Gibson believed about the death of Cory Lovelace.&nbsp; </p><p>"Adam Gibson decided to create a crime where one didn't exist," Curtis told Maher.</p><h2>BATTLE OF THE EXPERTS</h2><p>Prosecutor Ed Parkinson brings in three forensic pathologists to prove Detective Gibson's theory that Cory was murdered. </p><p>From world-renowned&nbsp; Dr. Werner Spitz: "Ms. Lovelace died in my view of suffocation," he told the court.&nbsp; </p><p>To Dr. Scott Denton, the pathologist first consulted when the case was reopened.&nbsp; "I would determine her cause of death to be suffocation," Dr. Denton testified.</p><p>And finally, Dr. Jane Turner, the out-of-state expert who also believes Cory was suffocated.&nbsp; Defense attorney Jon Loevy tries to discredit Dr. Turner, saying she never saw Cory's body and her opinion that Cory's body was in full rigor mortis conflicts with the first responders on the scene.</p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: For you to be right Jeff Baird has to be wrong about his assessment, right?</p><p><strong>DR. TURNER</strong>: Yes. </p><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: For you to be right paramedic Ballard has to be wrong about his assessment that the arm was still pliable. Correct?</p><p><strong>DR. TURNER</strong>: Yes. </p></blockquote><p>If Cory Lovelace's body was pliable, as the defense claims, full rigor mortis had not set in and she didn't die the night before.</p><p>And when Coroner Keller is cross-examined, Loevy belittles his role in the case:</p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: You were at the scene of Cory's death for all of five minutes. Correct, sir? </p><p><strong>CORONER JAMES KELLER</strong>: Probably, yes sir.</p></blockquote><p>Loevy came down hardest on Detective Gibson.</p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: You continued to pursue Mr. Lovelace, right? &hellip;Because you had already decided that this man must be guilty.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON</strong>: No. </p></blockquote><p>He grills Gibson about rigor mortis:</p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY:</strong> At what point did you learn that you were wrong that the body was in full rigor at the scene?&nbsp; </p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON</strong>:&nbsp; I don't know to this day that I'm wrong. </p></blockquote><p>Then, a new twist: Loevy accuses Gibson of withholding evidence -- emails that never made it into the first trial:</p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: You did delete all your emails in January 2016, did you not?&nbsp; </p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON</strong>: Yes.</p></blockquote><p>The defense was able to recover those emails. Loevy reads one email from a pathologist who told Gibson he could never make a good murder case since Cory's death had originally been ruled undetermined.</p><p>"'That is more than reasonable doubt in any reasonable person's mind,'" Lovey read aloud from the pathologiost's email.</p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: This email should've been turned over, right?</p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON:</strong> I-- I believe so. It should, yes.</p><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: You didn't turn it over, did you?</p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON</strong>: I did not.</p></blockquote><p>But Gibson testified that he never engaged in any intentional wrongdoing.</p><blockquote><p><strong>PROSECUTOR DAVID ROBINSON</strong>: And have you ever intentionally deleted or modified emails to manipulate an investigation?</p><p><strong>DET. GIBSON</strong>: No.</p></blockquote><p>Loevy calls to the stand his own noted pathologist, Dr. William Oliver -- who was on the O.J. Simpson case.&nbsp; Dr. Oliver had no doubt how Cory died.</p><p>"It is my opinion that she died of the complication of alcohol withdrawal known as acute fatty liver," he testified.</p><p>After a battle of the experts, the defense gambles that the most believable witness might be the accused killer himself.</p><p>"As I approached the bed, I could see her hands, I could see her eyes were open, and she was very pale and there was just &mdash;nothing there.&nbsp; Cory was dead.&nbsp; That's what I saw, that's what I saw," Curtis Lovelace told the court. </p><p>"I told them multiple times I had nothing to do with Cory's death," he testified.</p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY: </strong>Being accused of a cold-blooded murder, that reduces your likability factor, correct? </p><p><strong>CURTIS LOVELACE</strong>: (EMOTIONAL) A little bit.</p><p><strong>JON LOEVY: </strong>Do you feel like everything you say, every decision you make ,is now being picked over and being twisted unfairly. </p><p><strong>CURTIS LOVELACE</strong>: We have been doing this for two-and-a-half years.</p><p>And it was remembering the time right after Cory died&mdash;that Curtis became most emotional.</p><p><strong>CURTIS LOVELACE </strong>[EMOTIONAL]: &hellip;one of our high school classmates who was a pastor, he's the one that -- that delivered the eulogy. I wrote it, but I couldn't deliver it.</p></blockquote><figure class="embed embed--type-video is-video embed--float-left embed--size-large"><div class="embed__content-wrapper">

  </figure><p>All three Lovelace boys continue to support their father. The two oldest testify they saw their mother that Valentine's morning. </p><p>"I remember getting ready for school walking back and forth getting stuff done sitting on the stairs with my mother and heading out the door," Lincoln Lovelace told the court. </p><blockquote><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: How confident are you, though, from your memory itself, that you saw your mother alive that morning?</p><p><strong>LOGAN LOVELACE</strong>: One-hundred percent. </p><p><strong>JON LOEVY</strong>: Was this the last time you ever saw your mother alive?</p><p><strong>LOGAN LOVELACE</strong>: Yes.</p></blockquote><p>Their sister, Lyndsay, was not called to testify by either side.</p><p>As the trial goes to final arguments &hellip;</p><p>"Beyond reasonable doubt, ladies and gentlemen, is the standard... beyond reasonable doubt doesn't mean probably, doesn't mean maybe. Beyond a reasonable doubt," Loevy addressed jurors. </p><p>"''Cause really what the case is about is that lady, Cory. That's who the case is about. She died at the age of 38 because a 6'4" former football player standing over her muffled her and forgot to take the pillow away," Parkinson told the court.</p><p>&hellip;the question is whether any jury can sort out what exactly happened that Valentine's Day morning.</p><p>"Do you think we'll ever know what happened with your mom?" Maher asked Lyndsay Lovelace.</p><p>"No. If a verdict comes out this round, it comes out. I don't think we'll ever fully know," she said.</p><h2>A VERDICT&nbsp; <br></h2><p>All murder trials have their clashes between the prosecution and defense, but the spats between Ed Parkinson and Jon Leovy were more contentious.</p><p>"I would like to know who's coming like you bastards," Parkinson said to Loevy. </p><p>"Ed &hellip; act like you're winning . Pretend that you're doing OK," Loevy told Parkinson. </p><p>"I've objected to his antics. I've told him to shut up. I don't like him," said Parkinson.</p><p>After seven days of testimony in Curtis Lovelace's second murder trial, the jury continues hearing closing arguments"</p><blockquote><p>"So here we are. What has the state shown? Cory died from suffocation and he did it!" Prosecutor David Robinson told the court. "He had a motive &hellip; she was an alcoholic, she yelled at&nbsp; him, she yelled at the kids and that night he had enough &hellip; the state asks you to find Curtis Lovelace guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt."</p><p>"There is no evidence in this case that this woman was smothered. She died a natural death," Loevy told the court. "They have no murder weapon no forensic evidence &hellip; he went out trying to prove a case when there was no crime."</p><p>"This is a rebuttal &hellip; its not gonna take long. Because he committed a stupid crime, this Mr. Smart man here," Parkinson told jurors. "And you can do your job now because the only thing that makes sense here is that she was suffocated. Thank you."</p></blockquote><p>And with that the jury began their deliberations.</p><p>"I believe in everything we did -- every step that we took. It was a search for the truth," Curtis Lovelace told Maureen Maher.</p><figure class="image pull-left image-x-large "><span class="img "><img src="https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/19/2b85751c-2757-4211-93c3-d0da42b59832/resize/770x/b039e24c09476adda74c51963a067479/curtis-interview.jpg#" alt="curtis-interview.jpg " srcset="https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/19/2b85751c-2757-4211-93c3-d0da42b59832/resize/770x/b039e24c09476adda74c51963a067479/curtis-interview.jpg 1x"></span><figcaption><div class="caption"><p>"I believe in everything we did -- every step that we took.
